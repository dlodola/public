# About

I am a geologist with a strong background in STEM disciplines. I have spent the last 16+ years working as an explorationist in the oil and gas industry across a variety of roles.

My interest in programming goes back quite a way to when I wrote my first lines of code in my early teens on a BBC Micro Model B. It was a simple program that moved some shapes around the screen. Since then I have been exposed to a number of other languages, in particular PHP with which I taught myself object oriented programming during my graduate studies.

I started using Python _c._ 2018 when I began creating ArcGIS toolboxes to speed up some of my geospatial workflows. I quickly came to realize that Python was the perfect programming language for my needs: brutally efficient coding, highly versatile, and unlimited extensibility.
