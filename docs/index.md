# Welcome!

Welcome to the homepage of my public GitHub repository.

## Articles

You will find in the [How-Tos](./posts) section a number of articles on Python tricks and tools for exploration geologists and the wider geoscience community. I hope you will find them useful.

Many of these articles will have an accompanying Jupyter Notebook or a Python library. In the case of the former, a number of links to the notebook will be provided in the sidebar to the left. The table below gives an explanation of what these various links are. In the case of a library, a link to the appropriate Python file(s) will be provided.
