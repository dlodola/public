# Welcome!

Welcome to the homepage of my public GitHub repository.

You will find in the [How-Tos](./posts) section a number of articles on Python tricks and tools for exploration geologist and the wider geoscience community. Many of these articles will have an accompanying Jupyter Notebook or a Python library. In the case of the former, a number of links to the notebook will be provided in the sidebar to the left. The table below gives an explanation of what these various links are.

Most articles will feature a link to a LinkedIn post at the bottom of the page. Please follow that link if you wish to comment, ask a question, _etc._
